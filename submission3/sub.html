                Poultry provide humans with companionship, food and fiber in the form of eggs, meat and feathers. Many people love to raise and show chickens and other poultry species at fairs and other poultry shows. Others just love to raise them for backyard pets and for fresh eggs every day.

    	    <p>
    		    Beef is one of the most popular types of meat. It's exceptionally rich in high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals. Therefore, it may improve muscle growth and maintenance, as well as exercise performance. As a rich source of iron, it may also cut your risk of anemia.

             <p>
             	Sushi is not only important in Japanese culture and history, but it was a key stone in shaping the globalized food market into what it is today. Sushi would not be as popular today without advances in modern food globalization and transportation that were made simply to transport raw fish, more specifically tuna.
